# purple-line

libpurple (Pidgin, Finch) protocol plugin for [LINE](http://line.me/).

This is an attempt to resurrect the functionality of this plugin.

## TODO

- [ ] sniff out what connections are used with the LINE Chromium plugin
- [ ] update constants.hpp
- [ ] check which files need to be updated to lift the ban

The original README is preserved below:

## WARNING: Line Corporation is currently banning people for using 3rd party clients

There are multiple reports of accounts being permanently banned for using 3rd party clients such
as Pidgin. What exactly triggers the ban is unknown, but it's probably best to stick to the
official clients now.

For this reason I've broken the build on purpose. If you still want to test purple-line, you
should be able to figure out how to fix it yourself. Use at your own risk.

## Install from source (any distribution)

Make sure you have the required prerequisites installed:

* libpurple - Library that provides the core functionality of Pidgin and other compatible clients.
  Probably available from your package manager.
* thrift - Apache Thrift compiler. May be available from your package manager.
* libthrift - Apache Thrift C++ library. May be available from your package manager.
* libgcrypt - Crypto library. Probably available from your package manager.

To install the plugin system-wide, run:

    make
    sudo make install

The makefile supports a flag THRIFT_STATIC=true which causes it to download and build a version of
Thrift and statically link it. This should be convenient for people using one of the numerous
distributions that do not package Thrift.

You can also install the plugin for your user only by replacing `install` with `user-install`.

### Install on Windows

Pre-built binaries for Windows are available at [Eion Robb's website](http://eion.robbmob.com/line/).

If you want to use purple-line with Pidgin or Finch, copy libline.dll into `C:\Program Files (x86)\Pidgin\plugins\`
and libgcrypt-20.dll & libgpg-error-0.dll into `C:\Program Files (x86)\Pidgin\`.
