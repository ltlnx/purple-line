# SuperSonic's Develop Note

I had thought that re-build a project called "PidginLine" 2 years ago since the "purple-line" had was discontinued...

Anyway, the original project was updated last year!

So, I gave up it instead of updating the "purple-line".

Umm...I will keep updating its struct to connect LINE Services, nice to meet~
